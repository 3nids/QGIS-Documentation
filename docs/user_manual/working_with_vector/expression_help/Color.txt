   * - Description
     - Returns a darker (or lighter) color string

   * - Arguments
     - **color** - a color string

       **factor** - a integer number corresponding to the darkening factor:

       * if the factor is greater than 100, this functions returns a darker color (for e.g., setting factor to 300 returns a color that has one-third the brightness);<
       * if the factor is less than 100, the return color is lighter, but using the lighter() function for this purpose is recommended;
       * if the factor is 0 or negative, the return value is unspecified.

   * - Examples
     - ``darker('200,10,30',300)`` --> ``'66,3,10,255'``}
