las2las_filter
--------------

Description
...........

This tool uses las2las to filter LiDAR points based on different attributes and to write the surviving subset of points to a new LAZ or LAS file. For more info see the `las2las <http://rapidlasso.com/las2las>`_ page and its online `README <http://lastools.org/download/las2las_README.txt>`_ file.

Parameters
..........

``verbose`` [boolean]
  Generates more textual control output to the console.

  Default: *False*

``open LAStools GUI`` [boolean]
  Starts the GUI of LAStools with pre-populated input files.
  
  Default: *False*
  
``input LAS/LAZ file`` [file]
  The file containing the points to be processed.
