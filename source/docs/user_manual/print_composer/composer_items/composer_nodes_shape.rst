The Node-Based Shape Items
===========================

To add a node-based shape (polygon or polyline), click the
|addNodesShape| :sup:`Add nodes item` icon. Then perform a left click to
add a node to your current shape. When you're done, a simple right click
terminates the shape. Customize the appareance in the :guilabel:`Item Properties`
tab.

You can set the style of the shape using the advanced symbol style dialog
available thanks to the **[Change ...]** button in :guilabel:`Main properties`.

A specific tool is provided to edit node-based shapes through
|editNodesShape| :sup:`Edit Nodes Item`. Within this mode, you can select
a node by clicking on it (a marker is displayed on the selected node). A
selected node can be moved either by draging it or by using the arrow keys.
Moreover, in this mode, you are able to add nodes to an existing shape. You
just have to do a left click near a segment and if you are not too far from the
shape, a node is added. Finally, you can remove the currently selected node by
hiting the **DEL** key.
